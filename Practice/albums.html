        <h1>Artificial Selection</h1>
        <h2>2018</h2>
        <p>"Artificial Selection is a fine addition to not only the Dance Gavin Dance catalog but the entire stylistic
            landscape to which it belongs. While connections to other artists are clear, the quintet continues to
            maintain a distinctive, exploratory, and skillful identity in comparison to some equally popular peers." -

        <h1>Mothership</h1>
        <h2>2016</h2>
        <p>"When the youthful, carefree nature of the MySpace music revolution is finally forced to grow up, the result
            is something along the lines of Mothership. Upholding the lighthearted nature of humorously titled tracks,
            diverse riffs with layered vocals featuring flawless transitions between unclean and clean, and
            thought-provoking lyricism, Mothership is unexpectedly one of the most impressive records to be released in
            2016." - <b>New Noise</b></p>

        <h1>Happiness</h1>
        <h2>2009</h2>
        <p>"After the loss of two more members, and a time period of a six months in which to write and record,
            Happiness
            should have been nothing more than a horribly rushed and incoherent mess of an album. Yet somehow, Dance
            Gavin Dance has once again beaten the odds and created a rather impressive album." - <b>Sputnik Music</b>
