        <h2>The Band</h2>
        <p>
            Dance Gavin Dance is an American rock band from Sacramento, California, formed in 2005. The band currently
            consists of vocalists Tilian Pearson and Jon Mess, lead guitarist Will Swan, rhythm guitarist Andrew Wells,
            bass
            guitarist Tim Feerick, and drummer Matthew Mingus. The band formerly included lead vocalists Jonny Craig and
            Kurt Travis, and the lineup has changed several times since their inception. Swan and Mingus are the only
            band
            members who have appeared on every studio album.

        <h2>DGD and Happiness</h2>
        <p>
            In February 2009, the band went into the studio as a five-piece to record the follow-up to their self-titled
            album, yet again with producer Kris Crummett. The resulting album, Happiness, was released on June 9, 2009,
            less
            than one year after the release of their second studio album. Bassist Jason Ellis appears on Happiness,
            however
            left the group before its release, subsequently being replaced by Tim Feerick as a touring member. AllMusic
            gave
            a mixed review of the album, writing, "Happiness bristles with the kind of overachiever eclecticism that's
            as
            impressive as it is divisive," but that two songs were marred by the "nasally realm of high school emo,"
            leaving
            the listener unsatisfied with the experience.[9] A music video for the track "Tree Village" was released
            shortly
            after the album. The band embarked on tours with American rock bands Emarosa, Closure in Moscow, Scary Kids
            Scaring Kids, and others in support of the album.

            On June 19, 2019, the band released the single "Leave It All Behind", which is closer to their older sound
            than
            the poppier sound of Gossip, and announced their sixth studio album, How It Feels to Be Lost. It will be the
            band's first release under Sumerian Records.[21] On July 19, 2019, the band released the album's second
            single,
            "Break Me Down." On August 8, 2019, the band released the album's third single, "Agree to Disagree."
