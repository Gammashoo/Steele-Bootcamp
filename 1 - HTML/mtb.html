        <h2>Ode to the Bike</h2>
        <p>O mountain bike, O mountain bike,<br>
            how much excitement you bring me,<br>
            the way you move through the trails in between the trees,<br>
            the way the sounds of dirt crunching underneath<br>
            &Theta;<br>

            <p>A <b>mountain bike</b> or mountain bicycle is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling.
                Mountain bikes share some similarities with other bicycles,
                but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain,
                which makes them heavier, more complex and less efficient on smooth </p>

            <p>These typically include a suspension fork, large knobby tires, more durable wheels, more powerful brakes,
                straight, extra wide handlebars to improve balance and comfort over rough terrain, and wide-ratio
                gearing
                optimised for topography and application (e.g., steep climbing or fast descending). Rear suspension is
                ubiquitous in heavier-duty bikes and now common even in lighter bikes. Dropper posts can be installed to
                allow
                the rider to quickly adjust the seat height[3] (an elevated seat position is more effective for
                pedaling,
                but
                poses a hazard in aggressive maneuvers).</p>

        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>The original mountain bikes were modified heavy cruiser bicycles used for freewheeling down mountain trails.
            The
            sport became popular in the 1970s in Northern California, USA, with riders using older, single-speed balloon
            tire bicycles to ride down rugged hillsides.[11] These modified bikes were called "ballooners"<sup><a
                    href="httep://www.google.com/ballooners">[12]</a></sup> in
            California, "klunkers"[13] in Colorado, and "dirt bombers"[14] in Oregon. Joe Breeze, a bicycle frame
            builder,
            used this idea and developed what is considered the first mountain bike.[15]</p>

        <h3>Technical evolution</h3>
        <p>The evolution of mountain bike design can be seen from the successive mid-range product lines of the major
            manufacturers.</p>
