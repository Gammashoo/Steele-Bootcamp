    <h1>Tsunami</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A tsunami (/(t)suːˈnɑːmi, (t)sʊˈ-/ (t)soo-NAH-mee, (t)suu-;[1][2][3][4] from <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>: 津波, lit. 'harbour
        wave',[5]
        pronounced [t͡sɨᵝna̠mʲi]) is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of
        water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions
        (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or below
        water
        all have the potential to generate a tsunami.[6] Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind, or
        tides,
        which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the
        displacement of
        water by a large event.

    <h2>Tidal Wave</h2>
    <p>

        Tsunamis are sometimes referred to as tidal waves.[15] This once-popular term derives from the most common
        appearance of a tsunami, which is that of an extraordinarily high tidal bore. Tsunamis and tides both produce
        waves of water that move inland, but in the case of a tsunami, the inland movement of water may be much greater,
        giving the impression of an incredibly high and forceful tide. In recent years, the term "tidal wave" has fallen
        out of favour, especially in the scientific community, because the causes of tsunamis have nothing to do with
        those of tides, which are produced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun rather than the displacement of
        water. Although the meanings of "tidal" include "resembling"[16] or "having the form or character of"[17] tides,
        use of the term tidal wave is discouraged by geologists and oceanographers.

    <h2>Seismic Sea Wave</h2>
    <p>

        The term seismic sea wave is also used to refer to the phenomenon because the waves most often are generated by
        seismic activity such as earthquakes.[19] Prior to the rise of the use of the term tsunami in English,
        scientists generally encouraged the use of the term seismic sea wave rather than tidal wave. However, like
        tsunami, seismic sea wave is not a completely accurate term, as forces other than earthquakes—including
        underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, land or ice slumping into the ocean, meteorite
        impacts, and the weather when the atmospheric pressure changes very rapidly—can generate such waves by
        displacing water.[20][21]
